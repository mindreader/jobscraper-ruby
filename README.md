This was purely written as a demo to see how nice ruby could be.  There seem to be a plethora of web scraping libraries in this language, but I arbitrarily chose [nokogiri](nokogiri.org).

I would say the end result is pretty good considering how little time I spent on this.  I would definitely use ruby in the future for such tasks.  I am a little concerned at the speed of the script.
